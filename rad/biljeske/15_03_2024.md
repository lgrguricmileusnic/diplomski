**Sandbox**

A Sandbox contains the configuration of a container's network stack. This includes management of the container's interfaces, routing table and DNS settings. An implementation of a Sandbox could be a Linux Network Namespace, a FreeBSD Jail or other similar concept. A Sandbox may contain _many_ endpoints from _multiple_ networks.

**Endpoint**

An Endpoint joins a Sandbox to a Network. An implementation of an Endpoint could be a `veth` pair, an Open vSwitch internal port or similar. An Endpoint can belong to only one network and it can belong to only one Sandbox, if connected.

**Network**

A Network is a group of Endpoints that are able to communicate with each-other directly. An implementation of a Network could be a Linux bridge, a VLAN, etc. Networks consist of _many_ endpoints.


CNM Lifecycle

Consumers of the CNM, like Docker, interact through the CNM Objects and its APIs to network the containers that they manage.

rivers register with NetworkController. Built-in drivers register inside of libnetwork, while remote drivers register with libnetwork via the Plugin mechanism (plugin-mechanism is WIP). Each driver handles a particular networkType.

NetworkController object is created using libnetwork.New() API to manage the allocation of Networks and optionally configure a Driver with driver specific Options.

Network is created using the controller's NewNetwork() API by providing a name and networkType. networkType parameter helps to choose a corresponding Driver and binds the created Network to that Driver. From this point, any operation on Network will be handled by that Driver.

controller.NewNetwork() API also takes in optional options parameter which carries Driver-specific options and Labels, which the Drivers can make use of for its purpose.

network.CreateEndpoint() can be called to create a new Endpoint in a given network. This API also accepts optional options parameter which drivers can make use of. These 'options' carry both well-known labels and driver-specific labels. Drivers will in turn be called with driver.CreateEndpoint and it can choose to reserve IPv4/IPv6 addresses when an Endpoint is created in a Network. The Driver will assign these addresses using InterfaceInfo interface defined in the driverapi. The IP/IPv6 are needed to complete the endpoint as service definition along with the ports the endpoint exposes since essentially a service endpoint is nothing but a network address and the port number that the application container is listening on.

endpoint.Join() can be used to attach a container to an Endpoint. The Join operation will create a Sandbox if it doesn't exist already for that container. The Drivers can make use of the Sandbox Key to identify multiple endpoints attached to a same container. This API also accepts optional options parameter which drivers can make use of.

Though it is not a direct design issue of LibNetwork, it is highly encouraged to have users like Docker to call the endpoint.Join() during Container's Start() lifecycle that is invoked before the container is made operational. As part of Docker integration, this will be taken care of.
    One of a FAQ on endpoint join() API is that, why do we need an API to create an Endpoint and another to join the endpoint.
        The answer is based on the fact that Endpoint represents a Service which may or may not be backed by a Container. When an Endpoint is created, it will have its resources reserved so that any container can get attached to the endpoint later and get a consistent networking behaviour.

- endpoint.Leave() can be invoked when a container is stopped. The Driver can cleanup the states that it allocated during the Join() call. LibNetwork will delete the Sandbox when the last referencing endpoint leaves the network. But LibNetwork keeps hold of the IP addresses as long as the endpoint is still present and will be reused when the container(or any container) joins again. This ensures that the container's resources are reused when they are Stopped and Started again.

    endpoint.Delete() is used to delete an endpoint from a network. This results in deleting an endpoint and cleaning up the cached sandbox.Info.

    network.Delete() is used to delete a network. LibNetwork will not allow the delete to proceed if there are any existing endpoints attached to the Network.

### Handshake
Handshake **rjesava Handler iz go helpera**

When loaded, a remote driver process receives an HTTP POST on the URL `/Plugin.Activate` with no payload. It must respond with a manifest of the form

```
{
	"Implements": ["NetworkDriver"]
}
```

### Set capability

After Handshake, the remote driver will receive another POST message to the URL `/NetworkDriver.GetCapabilities` with no payload. The driver's response should have the form:

```
{
	"Scope":             "local"
	"ConnectivityScope": "global"
}
```

Value of "Scope" should be either "local" or "global" which indicates whether the resource allocations for this driver's network can be done only locally to the node or globally across the cluster of nodes. Any other value will fail driver's registration and return an error to the caller. Similarly, value of "ConnectivityScope" should be either "local" or "global" which indicates whether the driver's network can provide connectivity only locally to this node or globally across the cluster of nodes. If the value is missing, libnetwork will set it to the value of "Scope". should be either "local" or "global" which indicates
# 15.3.

### Join
When a sandbox is given an endpoint, the remote process shall receive a POST to the URL `NetworkDriver.Join` of the form

```
{
	"NetworkID": string,
	"EndpointID": string,
	"SandboxKey": string,
	"Options": { ... }
}
```

The `NetworkID` and `EndpointID` have meanings as above. The `SandboxKey` identifies the sandbox. `Options` is an arbitrary map as supplied to the proxy.

The response must have the form

```
{
	"InterfaceName": {
		SrcName: string,
		DstPrefix: string
	},
	"Gateway": string,
	"GatewayIPv6": string,
	"StaticRoutes": [{
		"Destination": string,
		"RouteType": int,
		"NextHop": string,
	}, ...]
}
```
...

The entries in `InterfaceName` represent actual OS level interfaces that should be moved by LibNetwork into the sandbox; the `SrcName` is the name of the OS level interface that the remote process created, and the `DstPrefix` is a prefix for the name the OS level interface should have after it has been moved into the sandbox (LibNetwork will append an index to make sure the actual name does not collide with others).
...

If no gateway and no default static route is set by the driver in the Join response, LibNetwork will add an additional interface to the sandbox connecting to a default gateway network (a bridge network named _docker_gwbridge_) and program the default gateway into the sandbox accordingly, pointing to the interface address of the bridge _docker_gwbridge_.
