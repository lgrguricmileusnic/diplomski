Jeftinija verzija Toyota PASTA-e s 4 ECU-a baziranima na [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) mikrokontrolerima. Teensy ima 3 interna CAN kontrolera od kojih se u powertrain, chassis i body ECU-ovima koristi samo jedan. Gateway ECU koji filtrira promet izmedju ECU-ova koristi sva tri i jedan dodatan vanjski CAN kontroler MCP2515.

An Arduino based remote car can be controlled using Value-Pasta-Auto. Minor changes for the lights were made to the code to control the lights from Value-Pasta-Auto. Arduino Sketch is in the Software folder.

### Car Hacking for Poories

- Charlie Miller i Chris Valasek, autori rada u kojem opisuju hakiranje Jeep-a
	- Remote Exploitation of an Unaltered Passenger Vehicle
- rad opisuje kako napraviti vlastiti test bench s prozivoljnim ECU-ovima za njihovo testiranje
- pokriva ozicenje, alate, reverzno inzenjerstvo, moguce probleme te spajanje tog test bencha na go kart

Primjerice ogranicenja test bencha:
	"Working on a CAN network on a workbench certainly has its advantages, such as cost
	and convenience. However, there are some significant drawbacks. No matter how
	accurate you try to make your artificial bench environment, you’ll be missing some
	ECUs, sensors/actuators, or some traffic or something (unless you’re a manufacturer
	who has a professional bench setup).
	It won’t be a perfect copy. For these reasons, some ECUs may not act exactly as they
	would in the vehicle. This can work both ways. You may send traffic to the ECU that
	won’t affect it on the bench but would have done something interesting in the car, since
	perhaps the ECU is not in the right state to receive these messages. Likewise, you may
	think you found a great attack against an ECU when in the car it fails to work, perhaps
	because of a safety feature around speed or gear of the vehicle.
	A great example of this is steering using the Toyota’s Lane Keep Assist (LKA) feature
	on the bench. Without the steering angle ECU reporting the angle (and a simulated
	angle of ‘straight ahead’), the LKA messages could be used to turn the wheel without
	the angle limitations adhered to in the car. The LKA scenario is interesting for two
	reasons. First, you might have thought you had a great attack that worked on the
	bench, but would not work properly in the car, due to angle turning limitations. Secondly,
	you could alter your attack in the car to always report ‘straight ahead’ as the steering
	angle in addition to the LKA messages."

	- softvera koji bi se mogao koristiti
	- vrsta izazova
- jako osnovno

- "...another major change could
also be to follow a similar approach as the picoCTF and to im-
plement challenges inside a virtualized environment, therefor
cutting the cost factor even more and nearly completely cutting
the hardware part"
